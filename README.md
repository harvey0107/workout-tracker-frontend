This is the client-side of the web application "Workout Tracker", a site for users to create and update their own workouts. Users can create, update see workout records and destory.

The client was built with JavaScript, CSS/SASS, HTML5, and Bootstrap. It interacts with a backend I built with JavaScript, Node, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose-- the GitHub repo and deployed heroku site can be found here: https://github.com/harvey0107/workout-tracker-api, https://murmuring-plateau-15464.herokuapp.com/

In building this project, I planned to finish the CRUD functionality with collections before I started working on the frontend. so i finished backend in first two day and start my authorization functions to make sure every users able to signUp, signIn ,signOut, and changePassword.
I started my the functions of my app after authorization. users able to create their exercise, weighs, sets then see and updatethe records and finally delete thire records. last but not least I used CSS and Bootstrap to design the layout and color of my app. 

In future versions, users will ideally make note to each of their workout record so users could markdown their progress after workout.
